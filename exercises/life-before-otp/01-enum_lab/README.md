# EnumLab

In this exercise we will reimplement parts of the Enum module. We will
restrict the functions we are allowed to use, so please don't use the
functions found in other modules from the Elixir standard library;
list comprehensions are also off limites.

This exercise serves to teach us about recursive functions. Unit tests
are provided in the form of doc tests, and will be run as part of the
regular `mix test`.
